<p>
    This extension adds a context menu option to calculate and apply anomaly ranks to selected HTTP requests. The
    anomaly rank is calculated using Burp Suite's built-in ranking utilities and displayed in the notes field of each
    request, making it easy to identify and prioritize potentially anomalous traffic during security testing.

<h2>Features</h2>

</ul>
